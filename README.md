## **Design**

### **Colour Scheme**

#### **Primary Colours**

![VR & R Hotel primary colour scheme used](assets/images/readme/primary-colours.jpg)

These are the colours used throughout the website. The intention was to have two lighter colours and two darker colours that could be mixed and matched while still complementing one another.

#### **Additional Colours**

![Additional colours used within the website](assets/images/readme/additional-colours.jpg)

These are the additional colours used. These were incorporated as a hover effect for buttons, theming the Halloween event and placeholder text.

### **Typography**

#### **Glitch Inside**

![Glitch Inside font used within the website](assets/images/readme/glitch-inside.jpg)

Glitch Inside was used for the company logo and also the headings. It was chosen as a visual representation of the virtual reality element of the business.

#### **Orbitron**

![Google Fonts Orbitron font used within the website](assets/images/readme/orbitron.jpg)

Google Fonts 'Orbitron' was the font used throughout the body of the website. It was chosen to envoke the idea that the concept is futuristic.

#### **Creepster**

![Google Fonts Creepster font used within the website](assets/images/readme/creepster.jpg)

Google Fonts 'Creepster' was the font used for the Coming Soon section of the home page. It was used to style the upcoming Halloween themed event.

### **Imagery**

All imagery used for the website was selected to be visually striking and adjusted using Pixlr where needed to reinforce the colour scheme. The hexagonal image shape was intended to reflex the idea of futuristic technology and to apply a consistant visual theme.

### **Wireframes**

All wireframes were created using Balsamiq for the following screen sizes:

### **Future Implementations**

#### **Restaurant**

The Restaurant was originally designed during my wireframes and was intended to be part of the Facilities page. However, as I began designing the website I felt that its inclusion was unnecessary for the projects scope.

This would be a section I would add at a later stage and would feature images of the restautant as well as menu items and guests enjoying the experience. It would also contain a short descriptive paragraph, an opening time table and a button link to the menu.

![Wireframe images of the proposed restaurant section](assets/images/readme/restaurant.jpg)

#### **Sign Up & Login**

I would like to include a Sign Up & Login section so that returning customers could have a smoother experience when making a booking as their details could be remembered.

#### **Members Page**

As an extension of the Login feature I would like to implement a members page which would track their progress made along the Loyalty Reward system. This page would also allow members to select the VR experinces that they most enjoyed so recommendations could be made to them for future visits.

*Thank You Page (Newsletter) - Initial Validation*

</details>

The initial validation for each page highlighted a consistant issue throught the website that needed correcting. As well as a few small issues in the Facilities and Booking page. The list of issues were as follows:

- Nesting a `<button>` inside an `<a>` element.

  - This was the method of navigation that I had used for many of the buttons throughout the website. My fix for this was to use a `<form>` that redirected the user upon submission. The `<button>` would then be changed to the submit input for the form.

- Facilities Page: Spelling error inside an `<a>` element.

  - Two anchor elements had a duplication of the `<a>` within the tag, so it displayed `<a a>`. This issue was also resolved by changing the `<button>` elements nested inside an `<a>` element.

- Booking Page: Unnecessary 'required' attribute inside select type `<input>` elements.

  - As the select type inputs used in the booking form had a value associated to each of the options. The 'required' attribute wasn't needed, as the first selectable option was chosen by default. My fix for this issue was to remove the 'required' attribute from these inputs.

- Booking Page: 'Required' attribute applied to `<label>` element.

  - The 'required' attribute had been applied to a form label in error. The fix for this was to remove this attribute.

#### **Second Validation**

![Second Validation Result](assets/images/testing/html-validation.jpg)

After implimenting the changes outlined above the second validation attempt showed no errors or warnings across all pages.

### **W3C CSS Validation**

![CSS Validation Result](assets/images/testing/css-validation.jpg)

No errors were found when using the W3C CSS Validator.

### **WCAG Color Contrast Checker**

I was mindful of having a high contrast when selecting the colour scheme for the website. Below are the results oor each of the background and foreground combinations used for this project.

![Grey Background, White Foreground](assets/images/testing/contrast-grey-white.jpg)

This is the primary colour scheme used in the navigation and footer section on each page.

![Grey Background, Yellow Foreground](assets/images/testing/contrast-grey-yellow.jpg)

This is the alternative colour scheme used in the navigation and footer section. It was applied to the hover effect of the navigation links, the font awesome icons and the headings of the footer.

![White Background, Grey Foreground](assets/images/testing/contrast-white-grey.jpg)

This is used in the sections with the white heaxagonal background and also the text boxes.

![Teal Background, White Foreground](assets/images/testing/contrast-teal-white.jpg)

This is the alternative colour scheme used for teal background sections and text boxes.

![Red Background, White Foreground](assets/images/testing/contrast-red-white.jpg)

This is used in the Unrest Beyond Reality section of the home page.

### **Bugs & Fixes**

</details>

<details><summary>Navigation Bar Position Change</summary>

<img src="assets/images/testing/navbar-bug.gif">

*Navigation Bar - Bug*

<img src="assets/images/testing/navbar-fix.gif">

*Navigation Bar - Fix*

</details>

The reason for this issue was that the heading section of the home page contained the company logo and slogan header. Whereas the other pages were just a hero image. Because the logo and slogan were responsive the size of the home page heading was relative to the display width. This made it challenging to keep the navbar at a consistant position across all pages.

The fix I implemented was to include the logo image and slogan header across all heading sections of the website.However, on the facilities and booking page I applied the BootStrap 'invisible' class to the rows containing the content. This allows the headings sections to be consistant across all pages without displaying the unwanted content. `<div class="row h-50 invisible">`

</details>

<details><summary>Booking Form Input Alignment</summary>

<img src="assets/images/testing/booking-form-bug.jpg">

*Booking Form - Bug*

<img src="assets/images/testing/booking-form-fix.jpg">

*Booking Form - Fix*

</details>

This bug was caused by having a single input within the top row of the form but all other rows having two inputs. Because of this it was difficult to align the 'Title' select box with the remaining inputs. With the spacing method of 'justify-content-evenly' being responsive. The alignment became more noticable on wider displays.

The fix I implemented was similar to the previous bug fix. I added an additional input to the top row but added the 'invisible' class to prevent it being dispayed. This allowed me to apply the same spacing method of 'justift-content-evenly' to the row and have the alignment match the other content exactly.

<details><summary>iPhone Text Decoration Not Displaying</summary>

<img src="assets/images/testing/text-decoration-bug.jpg">

*Text Decoration - Bug*

<img src="assets/images/testing/text-decoration-fix.jpg">

*Text Decoration - Fix*

</details>

The CSS 'text-decoration' property wasn't displaying on iPhone devices.

By including the additional line of `-webkit-text-decoration` to my CSS I was able to rectify this issue. However, the 'text-decoration' colour of the current webpage was displays as white instead of yellow. I was happy to leave this as it was a small detail that only effected the navbar.

<details><summary>Readme Table of Contents Issue</summary>

<img src="assets/images/testing/table-contents-bug.gif">

*Table of Contents - Bug*

<img src="assets/images/testing/table-contents-fix.jpg">

*Table of Contents - Fix*

</details>

This issue was caused by the table of contents section of the readme file being auto generated. This caused every heading on the page to be listed, including the page title which wasn't wanted.

After reporting my problem to the Slack community 'Laurie Crean' was able to suggest a fix. By applying `<!-- omit in toc -->` to the headings that I didn't want in the table of contents. They weren't targeted by the auto generation algorithm.

### **Known Bugs**

![iPhone Horizontal Display Bug](assets/images/testing/iphone-horizontal-bug.jpg)

Upon viewing the website on an iPhone held horizontally, the screen displays with a border. I'm not sure why this happens and have been unable to find a fix.

![Mozilla Firefox](assets/images/testing/firefox.gif)

The hexagonal containers used for the social media icons in the footer don't display correctly on firefox. It causes the border of the coantainer to be uneven. This is particularly noticable as the display is re-sized. I'm unsure of a possible fix to this.
